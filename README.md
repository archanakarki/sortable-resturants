# Sortable resturants
This react app fetches the data of resturants from a json file, displays it and provides features to sort the list in ascending, descending or revert to the original order.

### Task is to display a list of restaurants with sort functionality

    1) Build a web page that shows all fifty restaurants. At least three fields from resturant data are required.
    2) No restrictions on design so restaurants can be displayed vertically, horizontally, or on a grid. Aim should be for a clear and responsive design.
    3) In addition of rendering restaurants, possibility to sort restaurants alphabetically in ascending and descending order, e.g. by adding a sort-button on the top of the list should be created.
